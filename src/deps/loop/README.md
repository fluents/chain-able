* _ramda_
  + has a sanctuary structure to keep a standard, very extendable
  - is super hard to read [has a perf hit with the additional keys (minor)]
* _lodash_
  + has more functions to have easier ones to use the one you need,
  - but they are
* _chain-able_
  + has chains to iterate & transform on the classes which have the best names
  - has larger file size, longer to implement in a way that can be used fp & oop
  + could easily handle compatibility to allow api usage with ramda &| lodash, external functionality
