- [lego-api][lego-api] renders the infinitely nestable permutations of conditionals for [fuse-box][fuse-box] so only what you use is included in the bundled api
- [d-l-l][d-l-l] makes your webpack build faster, in just a few lines, without having to waste time with the tedious manual configuration steps required to use the DLLPlugin
- [webpack-split-plugin][webpack-split-plugin] easily split bundles into multiple pieces with custom specifications
- [bench-chain][bench-chain] benchmark recording - averages & graphs.
- [cli-chain][cli-chain] easy, powerful, interactive, infinitely nestable fluent cli builder.
- [awesome-fluents][awesome-fluents] more awesome fluents/chains

## [examples](https://github.com/fluents/chain-able/tree/master/examples)
- [playground - super small files using features - adapted from tests](https://aretecode.github.io/chain-able-playground/)
  - data type + schema
  - define
  - encase
  - merging
  - observing
  - LocalStorage
  <!-- - transforming -->
- minis - really mini projects for examples
  - decorators (making a chain that can be used to build decorators that work for all combinations*)
  - SwitchChain - making `switch {}` as a chain for fun
- typescript (for intelisense demo)
- decorators (for es6 transpiling experimenting)
- bundler configs (works by default, but easier the better)
- eventually (todo):
  - Events - will be an eventsource example
  - React & MobX
  - Routing
  - FileSystem stuff on nodejs
